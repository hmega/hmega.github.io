title: "About Me"
---

I grew up in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, and spent my childhood exploring the backcountry of New Mexico and Southern Colorado.  Every weekend my parents would load my sister and I up in our Ford Bronco and head to the woods to explore. My love for nature first began while riding in my dad's backpack on the long Colorado forest trails. As I grew older, my enchantment with nature and passion for the activites that brought me closer to it amplified. I have lived in Colorado, Lake Tahoe California, and the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. I spend my free time hiking, skiing, climbing, backpacking, fly fishing, and exploring the woods with my best friend and pup Koda.
