I used the chi-square test to test the association between political party identification and view on the dangers of global warming. I found that the p value was equal to .00000000000000022, therefore we can safely reject the null hypothesis with a 1% confidence level. This means that there is an association between political identity and views on the dangers of global warming. 

I then wanted to mitigate other potentially influential factors such as income and education. I used the linear regression model to view political party identification and its affect on a person's view of the dangers of global warming. Next, I wanted to control for education, and then education and income. I am not sure why, but the site is not showing linear regression models. 

```{r}
summary(lm(tempgen ~ partyid, data = gss))
summary(lm(tempgen ~ partyid, + educ, data = gss))
summary(lm(tempgen ~ partyid, + educ,+income, data = gss))
```
